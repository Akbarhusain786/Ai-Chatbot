Description:- I developed this chatbot project to automate responses based on predefined intents. The system processes user input using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, tokenizes and stems words, and categorizes sentences into predefined classes. It uses a neural network model built with TensorFlow to classify user queries and generate appropriate responses. The chatbot is trained on various patterns and responses, enabling it to understand and reply to common user questions. Additionally, the model is saved and can be reloaded for future use, ensuring efficient and consistent interaction.
